Toradex Apalis iMX6 STEP model
------------------------------

This zip file contains the STEP models for the Apalis iMX6 modules. Since the industrial
temperature graded version of the SoC (IT, -40 to 85°C) features an additional lid
(heat spreader) on top of the silicon, there are two different models available. The 3D
model is simplified and contains only the PCB and CPU. It is intended to be used for
heat spreader or heat sink designs. The CPU height is a typical value. Due to production 
tolerances, the actual height of the assembled component can be different. Please read
the according datasheet.
